# My Online Portfolio

## Introduction 

This personal portfolio website was created as an inspiration from Codecademy, and was a test to use the skills that I have learned so far to create a fully functioning online portfolio. This is where I will be putting my future projects and what I will use overtime to show my improvement as a web developer.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Command-line
* Github

## What I've learned

Making this website come to life was no easy task for a junior developer like me, but I learned a lot from it in the process. I learned a lot about font-awesome, which I used for my link icons and also hightened my skills greatly with flexbox. Finding out how to position everything was probably the hardest part for me, but now it will be easier in the future. My responsive design skills showed improvement becasue I was able to get the website working for mobile even though it isn't as interactive. I now know how to make a working dropdown menu with css and javascript as well, which proved to be a great challenge making it responsive when the page shrinks. Overall my skills as a web developer improved greatly.
